                        In this exercise we were working in groups and were given a client, I Bike Copenhagen, with a task to create them a website, which promoted biking in the city through different experiences.
                        <br>
                        The first main take-away from this exercise was learning how to work on a task, which would keep the goals and intentions of the project in the best interest of the client. That meant following the given guidelines, which made us rethink some design choices when finding the best solution for the client.

                    <p class="t1-03">
                        Another important take-away was learning how to work in a group. Given this was our first group assignment, working together with fellow classmates was a new task, and therefore quite challenging in the beginning of the working together. That included finding common ground amongst our opinions and visions, talking everything through but still try to make everyone’s ideas represented. Although difficult at first, through this I learned how to listen to others more carefully and work out a design solution considering everyone’s perspective and opinions.
                        <br>
                        My main task in this assignment with two other teammates was the design the interface for the website. For this we used a combination of methods we got to know the Gestalt principles and also color theory. We chose a warm and “romantic” color scheme for the site, to make it appealing for new visitors and show biking in an attractive light.
