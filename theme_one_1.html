                        In theme 01: Basic Web we learned about the basics of coding a website through the use of HTML and CSS web-development languages. To implement what we had learned, we had to build our own website.
                        <br>
                        The task was individual, with the goal of implementing a given art style into the design of the website. In addition, I had to produce content for the website. That included writing articles based on the given art style, and also showcase the design choices for the my website.
                        <br>
                        Through this I learned the basic of producing content and copywriting. Since to write the articles, I had to do research on the topics and then write the articles based on the gathered information.
                        <br>
                        In addition, I learned how to keep track of my work and document my process. This kind of overview of my work made me rethink some of the choices I had made along away and also reminded me of my good ideas.
                    </p>

                    <p class="t1-03">
                        The created website consisted of a title page and four sub-pages. All of them were coded responsive, making the interface adjust properly to different screen sizes. In addition, I used different image assets on different screen sizes, so the loading time for the pages would be as fast possible.
                        <br>
                        While both designing the UI and writing content were both quite challenging, the biggest learning curve for me was figuring out the use of HTML and CSS, since I had had no previous experience with them. Although difficult in the beginning, by the end of the assignment I had learned how to write semantic and valid basic code. </p>
