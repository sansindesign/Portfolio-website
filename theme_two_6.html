                        Here is the final result of the 2nd theme with a PDF with links to all of our teammatesâ€™ domains, which take you to the finished website. The website also includes the video we filmed over the last weeks of the 2nd theme.

                        While there were many aspects to the entire assignment that taught me things, the biggest take-aways came from everything related to producing the promotional video. Starting from coming with a good plot, planning out the storyboard to finding good locations for filming the video and editing it all into a final project.

                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVaBree6EnE" target="_blank">link to the promo video</a>
                        <img src="images/cycle2.png" alt="a still from the video">
                        <img src="images/cycle3.png" alt="a still from the video">
                    </div>
                    <p class="t1-03">
                        In making the final video, I had two main roles. The first was as an assistant on set, which meant I had to scout out for the locations before heading out to shoot and on the day of shootings I was in charge of time management. Due to one of our core aspects of the video being the atmosphere we wanted to create, we had to keep track of the sun so all of shots would be have warm and romantic colors.
                        <br>
                        In addition, I was one of the editors for the video, which again was a great learning experience since I would have to realize the story from the storyboard and present biking in Copenhagen in an attractive way through using different effects on Adobe Premiere and finding the right soundtracks.
