                        For the interactive animation which was the main assignment in theme 3, we were assigned into teams that consisted of coders, illustrators and UX people, 2 of each. For the animation we had to pick a well-known story and characters and create the plot and animation around our choice. Our team chose the animated movie Wall-E and decided to recreate the scene where Wall-E returns to earth after his mission in space to clean up the planet and take care of plants.
                        <br>
                        My main role in the assignment with Anele was to take care of the UX. That meant doing user testing on fellow classmates both before and after the coding had started. First using our storyboard for the animation, so we could know if anything needed improvement before our teammates started coding. We executed that through handing the test participants the storyboard and then asking them to explain what they were seeing back to us. This let us know if the story made sense or not.
                        <br>
                        In addition, we also concluded user testing after our teammates had coded the website. This was an expert test, were we tested the already coded website on our classmates. Based in the results we got valuable information to improve some aspects of the website.

                        Besides the user-testing, me and Anele created the persona collage and mood board for the project. The first one, to understand the client-base we are aiming for, so it would be easier to reference our design to something during our process and have the client always in mind. And we created the mood board, to have a concise visual understanding amongst our team for the final outcome.
                        <br>
                        In addition, I helped out the design team by drawing some of the illustrations, like the garbage bags. That was also a challenge since we wanted to create them in a realistic style for it to blend in better with the background, for which we used a real-life photo.
