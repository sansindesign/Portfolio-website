                        In this exercise I worked together with Martin and Dina to make a video following a story without out words. The goal was to have a video with a story that relied only on visual effects and background music. We also had limited time to make the video and were supposed to only use phones for filming, meaning we had to keep it simple yet come up with an effective result.
                        <br>
                        This was an excellent exercise to learn how to come up with an idea for a project quickly and then figure how to make the plans a reality. In addition, it was a great chance to experience working in a group dynamic, where everyone has a different opinion and wants their voice heard.

                        Through this exercise I also learned the basics of Adobe Premiere Pro, to edit a video with the goal to keep it short, entertaining and the message understandable. Although difficult to portray a story without words, I think we managed really well through the use of thrilling background music and the props used for visual effects.
                        <br>
                        My main task in this assignment was coming up with the plot for the video and how to make it translate well on screen by not using any words. That meant looking for the right background audio for the video and also planning out which props to use and what kind of a message they would send to the viewer. In addition, I had the role of acting in the video, which taught me a new how to create content â€“ by providing the content myself.
