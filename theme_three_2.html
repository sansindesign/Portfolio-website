                        Over the second week of the 3rd theme, I had to create a nuanced character profile. The profile had to have a back-story, visual appearance and a world to live in. To get inspired for the task and have a more precise goal we had to choose an inspiration and for that I chose Studio Ghibli.
                        <br>
                        The first challenge was coming up with a story for the character: to write down their emotions, feelings and their entire being. In addition, give their story a deeper meaning, which would resonate with others while not being overdone and a cliché. For that, I chose to portray the classical “good and bad choice” storyline in magical Studio Ghibli setting.
                        <br>
                        Another challenge was to design the character and the world around him, while being inspired by Studio Ghibli. While a fun task, it was quite tricky to get the atmosphere and vibe of the illustrations just right. To get the right look, I drew the characters with dark outlines and filled the bodies with single colors and minimal shadowing. That way, I managed to imitate the atmosphere in the Ghibli animations.

                    </div>
                    <p class="t1-03">
                        I also had to create a storyboard for the animation. Similar to the task in Theme 02, I had to draw out the story scene by scene so I would know how the animation would turn out before I started coding it.
                        <br>
                        In addition, some sort of an animation had to be coded through the use of a spite sheet and CSS animation techniques. I chose to draw a walking animation for the main character. For that I followed the animation principles to make the movement in addition to understandable also believable.
